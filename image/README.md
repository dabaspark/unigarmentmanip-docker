# Use the Pre-built Docker Image

This directory contains the script to run the UniGarmentManip environment using the pre-built image from Docker Hub. This is the fastest and recommended way to get started.

### Usage

1.  Make sure you have completed the "Prerequisites" in the main `README.md`.
2.  From the project's root directory, make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x image/run_image.sh
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    ./image/run_image.sh
    ```
This will pull the latest `dabaspark/unigarmentmanip` image and launch an interactive container session.

For more details, please refer to the main [README.md](../README.md).
